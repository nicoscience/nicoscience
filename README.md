## Hey there, welcome to my profile! 👋

I'm a skilled IoT Systems Specialist based in Auckland, New Zealand with 4 years of Python programming, dashboard creation, and service desk experience. Proactive, independent, and able to foster a positive team environment. Excellent communication and problem-solving skills. 

I'm working at AoFrio Ltd., a New Zealand-based company that designs, manufactures, and sells electronically controlled motors, smart refrigeration controls, and IoT systems (cloud-based equipment management and digital marketing) for the commercial refrigeration industry. Its primary customers are food and beverage retail brands and refrigeration equipment manufacturers worldwide.

As a person who codes and enjoys being around with so many talented individuals, I thrive in environments where I face real-life challenges that require learning a new skill in a short period of time. 

Some other activities I enjoy are climbing 🧗, dancing 🕺, and learning languages 📖,
